			<u>Tanhuma-yelamdenu</u>
		</h3>

		<p>The Tanhuma yelamdenu literature belongs to the genre of
			homiletic Midrashim. They consist of homilies for all passages of the
			Torah reading cycle as it was practiced in the Land of Israel in Late
			Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. In this reading cycle the Torah
			was read in three or three and a half years. For the particular
			readings on festivals and special Sabbaths corresponding homilies
			were added. Key features of the Tanhuma are the opening with a
			halakhic question, frequently preceding the regular openings.
			Compared to earlier exegetical midrash such as Genesis Rabba, Tanhuma
			uses less Aramaic and more Hebrew and differs in the length and style
			of the explanations. Tanhuma Yelamdenu Midrashim are found in
			different works and versions. The best known are the printed edition
			and the edition published by Buber. However also some of the Rabba
			Midrashim belong to these genre, as well as other texts found in the
			Cairo Geniza or cited in medieval anthologies. Because of the late
			nature of the Tanhuma Yelamdenu, their richness and complexity, these
			works were quite neglected and have never been published critically.
			Therefore we have chosen these texts to be the first to be dealt in
			Tikkoun Sofrim. By participating in the project you make a
			significant contribution to the accessibility of Jewish and Hebrew
			culture.</p>
